# Orbs 'n' Stuff

### What is it?
Orbs 'n' Stuff adds Diablo-esque "health drops" that heal the player on pickup, as well as other type of orbs that provide other bonuses.

### Features Include
Various orbs with buffs that drop from killing monsters.
* HP orbs that heal the player.
* XP orbs that grant bonus XP.
* Status orbs that grant temporary buffs
* Boss orbs that drop from first boss kills that grant the user a choice of permanent stat buffs.

### Roadmap
May add more types of orbs, more location-based drop mechanics, custom "orb" mobs that drop rare orbs.

Have thought about a loot orb that can contain pieces of a rare armor set, or trinket set, etc.
